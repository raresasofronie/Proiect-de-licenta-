Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.891 ns between key_expansion_unit/i_reg[0]_rep__1/C (clocked by clk) and key_expansion_unit/w_reg[28][8]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -9.910 ns between key_expansion_unit/i_reg[0]_rep__0/C (clocked by clk) and key_expansion_unit/w_reg[27][23]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
